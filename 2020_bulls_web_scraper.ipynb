    "## Project Purpose:\n",
    "### In this personal project, I will create a machine learning model that will accurately predict whether the Chicago Bulls basketball team will win a given game based on that games statistics (box score). To do this, I need a dataset containing the team's stat totals for all 72 regular season basketball games in the 2020-2021 season. \n",
    "### After some searching, I was unable to find such a dataset. However, I was able to locate a website that contained links to all 72 box scores. From these box score pages, I will scrape the desired data. When this is complete, I will clean and model the data to fit my requirements for this project. Next, I'll use this cleaned dataset to train and test my Random Forest model."
